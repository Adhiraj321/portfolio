                <p>A B.Com (Hons) graduate from the University of Delhi, with a strong interest in marketing, branding, and strategic communication. I’ve gained hands-on experience in fully managing social media, creating as well as ideating branding and marketing collateral, and supporting digital campaigns through internships and leadership roles.

                    From content creation and copywriting to coordinating teams and executing campaigns, I enjoy combining creativity with structure to deliver impactful, audience-focused communication.
                    Outside academics, I enjoy sketching, reading, gardening, and watching movies. I also have a deep interest in history and politics.
